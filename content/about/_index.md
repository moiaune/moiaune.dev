I'm Mads Moi-Aune. A 30-years old DevOps Engineer from Norway ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡´. I like to solve problems through code and spend most of my days doing so. Been programming since I was 12 years old. My journey started (as for most I believe) with HTML & CSS and then PHP. Later I fell in love with Javascript for a while.

I started professionally around 2015 and thats when I discovered Powershell, which I think is a awesome language. So, for the last 5-6 years I've mostly worked with Javascript and Powershell doing Servicedesk/Operations work. Recently I transitioned to DevOps deploying IaC, building pipelines and platform tooling (in Go). I'm existed to see what the comming years have to offer ðŸ˜Ž.

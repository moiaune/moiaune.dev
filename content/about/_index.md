My name is Mads Moi-Aune. I'm a 30-years old DevOps Engineer from Norway ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡´. I like to solve problems through code and spend most of my work doing so. I started to dabbel with programming when I was about 12 years old. My journey started with web development in HTML & CSS and PHP. Around the time jQuery became popular I fell in love with Javascript for a while.

I started professional career around 2015 working in IT support. Thats when I discovered Powershell, which I think is a awesome language. For the last 5-6 years I've mostly worked with Javascript and Powershell doing Servicedesk/Operations work managing Microsoft 365 and Windows and developing applications in ServiecNow. Recently I transitioned to DevOps deploying Infrastructure-as-Code, building pipelines and platform tooling both in Go and ofcourse Powershell. I'm existed to see what the comming years have to offer ðŸ˜Ž

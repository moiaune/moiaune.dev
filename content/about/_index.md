I'm Mads Moi-Aune. A 29-years old DevOps Engineer from Norway 🇳🇴. I like to solve problems through code and spend most of my days doing so. Been programming since I was 12 years old. My journey started (as for most I belive) with HTML & CSS and then PHP. Later I fell in love with Javascript ❤️.

I got my first "real" job around 2015 and thats when I discovered Powershell, which I think is a awesome language. So, for the last 5-6 years I've mostly worked with Javascript and Powershell doing Servicedesk/Operations work. But I recently transitioned to DevOps, and my new-found love is Go (or golang). So I'm existed to see what the comming years have to offer 😎.
